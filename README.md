# Open Source Book Quotes


This is a repo for people who want to put their quotes from books to the https://citing.site page.
The page is being automatically updated after merging with master. If you want to contribute with your books and your quotes make a commit to a new branch and ask me for a pull request.

Posts have to be written in markdown language. You can find an explanation how to do it on the site itself in "About It" tab.

Short instruction on how to cooperate:

1. Clone repository and learn it's structure
2. Find posts files and Create one (don't forget about creating your account)
3. Commit the changes to your branch and ask for pull request
4. Your changes will appear once they are approved (we don't want spam or nasty pictures)
5. Your quotes are visible on the webpage all over the world
