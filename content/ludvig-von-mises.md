## Human Actions

To start this blog let's mention one of Mises' quotes:

> “He who only wishes and hopes does not interfere actively with the course of events and with the shaping of his own destiny.” ― Ludwig Von Mises, Human Action: A Treatise on Economics

I have finally found some time to write down all the best quotes from volume one that I've read so far. I must say, it's getting more and more difficult with all the plans and rational thikinkg but I'm trying my best. This is a part of it. Let's start:

> What counts is a man's behaviour, and not his talk about planned but not realized act.

> The vigorous man industriously striving for the improvement of his condition acts neither more not less thn the lethargic man who sluggishly takes thinfs as they come. Fot to do nothiking and to be idle are also action, they too determine the course of events.

> Acting man is eager to substitute a more satisfactory state of affairs for a less satisfactory.

> A man perfectly content with the state of his affairs would have no incentive to change.

> A third condition is required: the expectation that purposeful behaviour has the power to remove or at least to alleviate the felt uneasiness.
