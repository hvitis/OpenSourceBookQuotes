## Rich Dad, Poor Dad
### by Robert T. Kiyosaki

This book was bought by me a few years ago I think. I bought it in polish and have it until this day. Unfortunately I did not read it at that time. It seemed cliche for me. Maybe because of translation, I don't know. Now I'm reading it in Spanish and I'm really satisfied. I'm learning Spanish and the sound of economic vocabulary is great in that language. Kiyosaki is not the best writes, he even admits it in the book. Stories in the book, at lest some of them are like Jesus' allegories for common people. Maybe that was his idea of reaching a wide audience. Nevertheless his ideas can't be wrong if applied well. Work and save money while you're doing it. Then invest but only if you know what you are doing. If not, go to work or course where you will learn how to because knowledge is ultimately what gives you money. It's always in your brain, and it can help you with spotting an opportunity around the corner. I think I should have read this book long time ago (partially because of vocabulary and those allegories that are pointing to people who just turned out to be 20) but it's always better late then never. It's a must read if you are struggling with money or thinking about your next 20 years. I will show you a few quotes and reccomment buying the book, it's like 5 bucks and it's a good investment in your knowledge.


> Las oportunidades van y vienen, y ser capaz de tomar decisiones es una habilidad fundamental.

That is why I'm always trying to catch the opportunities. That's why I always write them down, I always try to follow them - maybe it's childish because I never will get all of them but I'm just giving life a chance in moments that are worth it.

> La majorparte del tiempo no te habla, solo te va empujando por ahi. Sin embargo, cada empujon es su forma de decir: "Despierta, hay algo que quiero que aprendas.

I had this exactly moment in my life when I was with my ex for too long. I was dreaming about going to live in another country for a while but I had to postpone it quite a few times. Those were the pushes that led me to participating in voluntary service that finally led me here. I always take decisions after a few pushes just to "make sure". I wonder how is it to take this kind of decisions immediately, anticipating those pushes.

> Siempre me piden un empleo y una nomina, pero nunca conocimiento. Es por eso que la gran mayoria pasara los mejores años de su vida trabajando para obtener dinero, sin entender a fondo por que lo hace.

Well, asking your boss about his experience just to create same enterprise as he has to increase the level of competition and make his life worse is not a good idea - if you want to persist in your position. There are fortunately people who tell to everyone what and how they do things (Warren Buffet or Elon Musk).

> La mayoria de las personas quieren que los demas cambien, pero ellas no estan dispuestas a hacerlo. Es mas facil cambiarte a ti que a los demas.

This is very powerful phrase and can help everyone with his problems. People who for example are angry about events that they can't predict like: firing from a job or rape, can prepare by changing themselves. Changing their knowledge in order to get another job easily (or get a promotion in a current one) or to learn some martial arts to prevent such a horrible thing like rape.

> El miedo es lo que hace que la mayoria de la gente trabaje para consequir dinero: el miedo a no poder pagar sus facturas; el miedo a ser despedidos; el miedo a no tener suficiente dinero y el miedo a empezar de nuevo.

This book is for everyone since it can help just about anyone. First I was thinking that author generalizes to get more readers and not everyone will have his own company because not everyone has qualities of entrepreneur or a leader. Later I understood that this book can help also people who want to have a better job, or maybe they want to change the attitude in their work and "unslave" a bit. Pushing a bit towards the light is always good.

> Muchos desean consequir dinero porque creen que con el pueden comprar felicidad. Sin embargo, la felicidad que trae el dinero consigo dura poco.

Sometimes I find myself really dreaming about an object, for example about a car that I don't need or another unicycle. It is true that the power of marketing and our times planted a seed in peoples head that objects bring happiness and it's true, a new Tesla would make me really happy, but after that I would got accustomed to it and I would not use it much. It's crucial to buy things that are really necessary but how to do it? Postpone the shopping as long as possible?

> En realidad lo que me interesa no es que aprendais a hacer montones de dinero, pues no os servira para enrentaros al miedo o al deseo. Incluso si llegais a ser ricos, si no aprendeis a manejar estas emociones, solo os habreis convertido en esclavos bien pagados.

This quote is continuation of my thought. Really controlling your needs and emotions can make you rich immediately. When I really thing about things that I can't live without I get a calculation equal to one of my salaries. In theory I can start having fun with trying out all the ways of getting more money next month. When can you start?

> Lo verdaderamente cruel es pasar la vida con miedo y nunca persequir tus sueños.

The down side of this quote is that some people's problem is that they don't have dreams and they keep living dreams of other people. People without passions are either sad, either boring or lost. What keeps you moving forward?

> Un empleo es una solucion a corto plazo para un problema permanente. La mayoria de la gente solo tiene un problema en mente, e es un problema inmediato: los recibos que debe pagar a final de mes.

This is easy to say but it's true that some people find themselves in those kind of situations. There is always a way of having a better life and it always depends on that very person, not the environment or others. Except communist countries, nobody is forced to work. That means that everyone can chose what would he wants to do and then strive toward that goal.

> Con frecuencia, en lugar de confiar en su sabiduriapersonal, en ese genio e inteligencia que radica en cada uno de nosotros, la gente solo imita a la multitud. [...] Era un hombre que no siguio a las multitudes, que llego a sus propias conclusiones y que destaba la frase: "Tenemos que hacerlo de esta manera porque asi lo hace todo mundo"

Be that very person, always think on your own. You can always follow the majority but only if you can explain why. It's just a common quote to remind you that if you want to get closer to "the 1%" you have to differ from the majority.

> Se encuentran cargados de pasivos y no cuentan con activo legitimos que puedan producirles ingresos. Por lo general, la unica fuente de ingresos. Por lo general, la Unica fuente de ingresos de la clase media es su nomina, y por eso, su estilo de vida depende por completo de su empleador.

That's realy scary for me from todays perspective. I don't want to work all life without having one or two years of break for example. 

> Recuerda que para la gente que cuenta con educacion financiera invertir no implica riesgos tan grandes.

That's very important quote. Knowledge is power. Of course it's impossible to rpedict the future but knowing economy and its principles it's possible to deduct consequences of certain actions which affect the future.

> La riqueza es la capacidad de una persona para sobrevivir cierta cantidad de dias, a futuro, O, dicho de otra manera: si dejara de trabajar hoy, ¿cuanto tiempo podria sobrevivir?

I like this idea. It's like saying that people say: "Time is money". It is, so what? Always try to translate it or make an allegory to the present situation.

> Como articulos que compraste alguna vez y ahora estan cubriendose de polvo en el garaje.

Oh, thank you for reminding me. No more redundant crap.

> En primer lugar, todos trabajan para los dueños de las empresas, luego para el gobierno a traves de los impuestos y, finalmente, para el banco en donde obtuvieron su prestamo hipotecario.

In Poland a person starts working for "herself" statistically after 6th month of the month. I've always found it terryfing. Now even more when I think that half of the time that is left I work for somebody else. 

> Se trata del tercer secreto de los ricos: ocupate de tu propio negocio.

I think it seems to be the best way according to the book. There is many other ways of earning, bonds, stocks, commodities, real estate but to get all of that you need to have moey first and to have a lot of it you need to make a lot. If you are having realy good salary maybe it's possible to save up but normally the focus only on starting a company.

> Voy a volver a inscribirme en la escuela para estudiar mas y conseguir un empleo mejor. Voy a trabajar horas extras. Tal vez pueda conseguir un segundo empleo.

How many times I was thinking in the exact same way.. Even now.. It's good to have other point of view by reading this book. Some people may find it radical or impossible but it is not. It's  worth trying. 

> Ahora ocupate de tu propio negocio. No renuncies a tu empleo pero comienza a comprar activos. Deja de adquirir pasivos o efectos personales que pierden su valor real en cuanto los llevas a casa.

Very good advice, save up, invest, don't but stupid things again.

> Negocios que no exigen mi presencia. Yo soy el dueño pero otras personas los administran. Si tengo que trabajar ahi, entonces no se negocio. Si tengo que ir, se convierte en mi empleo.

That's good way to put it but on the other hand there are people who either want to do everything on their own - letting your baby that gives money to some stranger is risky. Other reason why they keep working in the company is free time. I know people who just can't stand having it, then - work in your own company must be a pleasure.

> Deja de adquirir pasivos.

For the third time!

> El problema es que, quienes pierden siempre son los que no estan bien informados: aquellos que todos los dias se levantan y con toda diligencia van a trabajar y a pagar impuestos.

That was with the bitcoin last year. The bubble was rising and the people who have heard of it last and joined, lost.


> Prefiero abrirle los brazos al cambio en lugar de temerlo. Prefiero alegrarme por la perspectiva de hacer millones, en ligar de preocuparme por no obtener una subida de sueldo.

That's an easy calculations. If one has a stable job he has certainty of earning X all the time so in fact trying to go into a risky investment is not risky at all. Risky is putting 100% of money being unemployed into one-hand mashine or rullette.

> Actualmente, todo se centra en la informacion.

That's a quote from tens of years ago and it's cool to see it nowadays where it has gotten more value.

> La oportunidad de su vida les pasa por delante  y no la ven. Un añ despues se enteran, cuando ya todo el mundo se hizo rico.

Bitcoin.

> Y si tu quieres ser mas afortunado y generar mas dinero en lugar de continuar trabajando duro, entonces es fundamental que desarolles tu inteligencia financiera. Si eres el tipo de persona que esta esperando a que suceda lo correcto, podrias quedarte asi por mucho tiempo.

Work hard but set your goals straight if you want to achieve it. Working hard and ripping your guts off for something you are creating is always worth it because the ownership is yours.

> La mente es el activo mas poderoso que tenemos. Si la entrnamos bien, puede producir una enorme riqueza en lo que parecera solo un instante.

Let's just say that facebook was not there a few years ago. Not even Mark Zuckerberg knew about it.

> Las inversiones van y vienes. El mercado baja y sube. Las economias majoran y colapsan. El mundo te ofrece todo el tiempo oportunidades unicas, lo hace todos los dias, pero con frecuencia no las identificamos. Las oportunidades, sim embargo, estan ahi de cualquier manera, y cuanto mas cambien el mundo y la tecnologia, mas oportunidades habra de que tu y tu familia alcanceis seguridad en el aspecto economico durante muchas generaciones mas.

People are different but amongst us there are persons that know how to observe others, how to know what people need. Sometimes it's just observing your life and fixing your need but on a bigger scale. The point is that we don't live in end times and there is still a lot to fix and a lot to change and remember:

> Las grandes oportunidades no se ven con los ojos sino con la mente.


If I don't know what is a blockchain and why it can have impact on the world I don't invest in a cryptocurrency because:

> Si la oportunidad es demasiado compleja y no entiendo bien la inversion, no participo. Si sabes bien que haces, entonces no es como si estuvieras aposando. Apostar es meter dinero a un negocio y ponerse a rezar para que al azar te favorezca.

- - - 

> La principal diferencia entre una persona rica y una pobre es la forma en que manejan el miedo. La gente no tiene exito economico porque su miedo a perder dinero es mucho mayor que su anhelo de hacerse rica.

To sum up I think that the most important quote of the book is about loosing because this is inevitable consequence of taking a risk. You can loose less often knowing more but it's not possible to not loose anything. So...

> Perder inspira a los ganadores. Y a los perdedores, los vence.

Now let's back to work and use the focue rule:

> FOCUS: follow one course until succesful
