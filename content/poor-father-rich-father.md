## Rich Dad, Poor Dad
### Robert T. Kiyosaki

This book was bought by me a few years ago I think. I bought it in polish and have it untill this day. Unfortunately I did not read it at that time. It seemed cliche for me. Maybe because of translation, I don't know. Now I'm reading it in Spanish and I'm really satistied. I'm learning Spanish and the sound of economic vocabulary is great in that language.



> Las oportunidades van y vienen, y ser capaz de tomar decisiones es una habilidad fundamental.

That is why I'm always trying to catch the opportunities. That's why I always write them down, I always try to follow them - maybe it's childish because I never will get all of them but I'm just giving life a chance in monents that are worth it.

> La majorparte del tiempo no te habla, solo te va empujando por ahi. Sin embargo, cada empujon es su forma de decir: "Despierta, hay algo que quiero que aprendas.

I had this exactly moment in my life when I was with my ex for too long. I was dreaming about going to live in another country for a while but I had to postpone it quite a few times. Those were the pushes that led me to participating in voluntary service that finally led me here. I always take decisions after a few pushes just to "make sure". I wonder how is it to take this kind of decisions immediately, anticipating those pushes.

> Siempre me piden un empleo y una nomina, pero nunca conocimiento. Es por eso que la gran mayoria pasara los mejores años de su vida trabajando para obtener dinero, sin entender a fondo por que lo hace.

Well, asking your boss about his experience just to create same enterprice as he has to increase the level of competition and make his life worse is not a good idea - if you want to persist in your position. There are fortunately people who tell to everyone what and how they do things (Warren Buffet or Elon Musk).

> La mayoria de las personas quieren que los demas cambien, pero ellas no estan dispuestas a hacerlo. Es mas facil cambiarte a ti que a los demas.

This is very powerful phrase and can help everyone with his problems. People who for example are angry about events that they can't predict like: firing from a job or rape, can prepare by changing themselves. Changing their knowledge in order to get another job easily (or get a promotion in a current one) or to learn some martial arts to prevent such a horrible thing like rape.

> El miedo es lo que hace que la mayoria de la gente trabaje para consequir dinero: el miedo a no poder pagar sus facturas; el miedo a ser despedidos; el miedo a no tener suficiente dinero y el miedo a empezar de nuevo.

This book is for everyone since it can help just about anyone. First I was thinking that author generalizes to get more readers and not everyone will have his own company because not everyone has qualities of enterprenuer or a leader. Later I understood that this book can help also people who want to have a better job, or maybe they want to change the attitude in their work and "unslave" a bit. Pushing a bit towards the light is always good.

> Muchos desean consequir dinero porque creen que con el pueden comprar felicidad. Sin embargo, la felicidad que trae el dinero consigo dura poco.

Sometimes I find myself really dreaming about an object, for example about a car that I don't need or another unicycle. It is true that the power of marketing and our times planted a seed in peoples head that objects bring happiness and it's true, a new Tesla would make me really happy, but after that I would got accusstomed to it and I would not use it much. It's crucial to buy things that are really necessary but how to do it? Postpone the shopping as long as possible?

> En realidad lo que me interesa no es que aprendais a hacer montones de dinero, pues no os servira para enrentaros al miedo o al deseo. Incluso si llegais a ser ricos, si no aprendeis a manejar estas emociones, solo os habreis convertido en esclavos bien pagados.

This quote is continuation of my thought. Really controlling your needs and emotions can make you rich immediately. When I really thing about things that I can't live without I get a calculation equal to one of my salaries. In theory I can start having fun with trying out all the ways of getting more money next month. When can you start?

> Lo verdaderamente cruel es pasar la vida con miedo y nunca persequir tus sueños.

The down side of this quote is that some people's problem is that they don't have dreams and they keep living dreams of other people. People without passions are either sad, either boring or lost. What keeps you moving forward?

> Un empleo es una solucion a corto plazo para un problema permanente. La mayoria de la gente solo tiene un problema en mente, e es un problema inmediato: los recibos que debe pagar a final de mes.

This is easy to say but it's true that some people find themselves in those kind of situations. There is always a way of having a better life and it always depends on that very person, not the environment or others. Except communist countries, nobody is forced to work. That means that everyone can chose what would he wants to do and then strive toward that goal.

> Con frecuencia, en lugar de confiar en su sabiduriapersonal, en ese genio e inteligencia que radica en cada uno de nosotros, la gente solo imita a la multitud.

> Era un hombre que no siguio a las multitudes, que llego a sus propias conclusiones y que destaba la frase: "Tenemos que hacerlo de esta manera porque asi lo hace todo mundo"
