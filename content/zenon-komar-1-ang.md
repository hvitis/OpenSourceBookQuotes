## The art of speculation renewed vol. 1

### Zenon Komar

> Mental capital exceeds financial capital.

> Above all you have to maintain your capital, you can-t loose money.

> Getting to know the reasons why people lose money and cutting loses will make profits appear naturally.

> Some people get excited only by playing. We call them gamblers.

> Make a list of everything you want to achieve. Everything.
