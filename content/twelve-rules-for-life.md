## 12 Rules for Life
### by Jordan Peterson

1.
> It is because we are born human that we are guaranteed a good dose of suffering. And chances are, if you or someone you love is not suffering now, they will be within five years, unless you are freakishly lucky. Rearing kids ishard, work is hard, aging, sickness and death are hard, and Jordan emphasized that doing all that totally on your own, without the benefit of a loving relationship, or wisdom, or the psychological insight of the greatest psychologist, only makes itharder.

2.
> I suggested that our ancestors portrayed the world's a stage and drama instead of a place for object 

3.
> People who live by the same code are rendered mutually predictable to one another. They act in keeping with each others expectations and desires. They can cooperate. They can even compete peacefully because everyone knows what to expect from everyone else. A shared belief system, partly psychological, partly acted out, simplifies everyone - in their own eyes, and in the eyes of others. 

4.
> The forces of tyranny expand inexorably to fill the space made available for their existence.

5.
 > The world is still there with its structures and limits. As you move along with it, it cooperates or object. But you can dance with it, if your aim is to dance - And maybe you can even lead, If you have enough skill and enough grace.

6.
 > You have to consciously to find the topic of the conversation, particularly when it is difficult or it becomes about everything And everything is too much. This is so frequently why couples cease communicating.

7.
 > If you pay careful attention even on a bad day, You may be fortunate enough to be confronted with small opportunities of just that sort Maybe you will see a little girl dancing on the street because she's all dressed up in a ballet costume. Maybe you will have a particularly good Cup of coffee in a cafe that cares about their customer. Maybe you can steal 10 or 20 minutes to do some little ridiculous thing that distracts you or reminds you that you can laugh at the absurdity of existence.

8.
 > Failure to make the proper sacrifices Failure to reveal yourself Failure to live and tell the truth All that weaknesses You. In that weakened state You will be unable to thrive in the world And you will be of no benefit to yourself or to others. You will fail and suffer, stupidly.
