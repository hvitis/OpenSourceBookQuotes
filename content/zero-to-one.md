## Zero to one

### by Peter Thiel

Want to start a company? Start-up? Well, this book is about principles that are observed in big companies success by an author and investor of some of them. Musk's friend, buissnessman and thinker tells us how to achieve success in a brutal way - using reality and facts. That's why for me it's very close to earth opinions that are worth knowing. The book destroys some of schemes about old stoneish reality that you are struggling with and gives you very fresh view. Almost like the author had lived in a future for a while and then made an opinion about our times. Let's kick off with a few quotes.

> This book offers no formula for success. Tha paradox of teaching enterprenuership is that such formula neessarily cannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe in concrete terms how to be innovative.

That's why you can't teach "startuping" at school. It's impossible to teach person this spark that few people have. All that buissness plan courses are mostly for accouting or laws that helps a bit with being a "person for everything" but it's not really teaching enterprenuership.

> If you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made horizontal progress. If you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you have made vertical progress.

I would say that If you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made horizontal progress. If typewriter doesn't exist and you built 1, you have made vertical progress. That's the point of the book's title that will be explained later.

> The smartphones that distract us from our surroundings also distract us from the fact that our surroudings are strangely old: only computers and communications have improved dramatically since midcentury.

That strikes me very much. The technology that we have today is not used well, to it's full potential. Goverments still have tons of paper, still the same procedures, at school things are taught in the same way even tho children can use amazing tools and powerful learning trees. Changes are comming tho. Their pace has to be slow because jobs that those changes will replace with robots or technology will be difficult to leave for people. Cashier, driver, courier, anyone can do it and for those people would be dificult to change the sector.

> If you are less sensitive to social cues, you're likely to do the same thing as everyone else around yoo. If you are interested in making things or programming computers, you'll be less afraid to pursue those activities single-mindedly and thereby become incredibly good at them. This can save you from getting caught up in crowds competing for obvious prizes. Competition can make people halucinate opportunities where none exist.

That's a great conclusion of competition at University. Place that has to give people knowledge or truth is a place of rat race. Majority of doctors for example will end up in hospitals, clinics or will have some research funds. That's it. This book is about start-ups that aspire to change the world and about this kind of competition. If you compete with other doctors instead of collaborating that doesn not bode well for the patients.

> The initial markets are so small that they often don't even appear to be buissness opportunities at all.

Some private hobby that a person has can convert into something big when snowball effect if involved.

> A good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design.

This is very interesting but I think that author should have elaborate on that since I'm not sure what it means. Should I search for an idea to build it into first design or he meant more technical approach like design patterns and coding architecture - if the start-up is an application.

> The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentraded together by few or no competitors.

This is gold.

> As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don't disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible.

> Jose Raul Capablanca said: To succeed you must study the endgame before everything else.

> We are more fascinated today by statistical predictions of what the country will be thinking in a few weeks' time than by visionary predictions of what country will look like 10 or 20 years from now.

> A startup is the largest endeavour over which you can have a definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust Tyrrany of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.

> You should focuse relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.

> The best enterpreneurs knows this: every great buissness is built around a secret that's hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirador.

> A start-up messed up at it's foundation cannot be fixed.

> Founders should share a prehistory before they start a company together - otherwise they're just rolling a dice.

> A product is viral of its core functionality encourages users to invite their friends to become users too.

> The most valuable buisnesses of coming decades will be built by enterprenuers who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete.

> Doing something different is what's truly good for society - and it's also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market.

> Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better - to go from 0 to 1.
