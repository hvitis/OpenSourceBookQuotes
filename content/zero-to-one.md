## Zero to one
### by Peter Thiel

Want to start a company? Start-up? Well, this book is about principles that are observed in big companies success by an author and investor of some of them. Musk's friend, buissnessman and thinker tells us how to achieve success in a brutal way - using reality and facts. That's why for me it's very close to earth opinions that are worth knowing. The book destroys some of schemes about old stoneish reality that you are struggling with and gives you very fresh view. Almost like the author had lived in a future for a while and then made an opinion about our times. Let's kick off with a few quotes.

> While I have notices many patterns, and I relate them here, this book offers no formula for success. Tha paradox of teaching enterprenuership is that such formulaneessarily cannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe in concrete terms how to be innovative.

> "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"

> If you take one typewriter and build 100, you have made horizontal progress. If you have a typewriter and build a word processor, you have made vertical progress.

> Any new and better ways of doing things is technology

> The smartphones that distract us from our surroundings also distract us from the fact that our surroudings are strangely old: only computers and communications have improved dramatically since midcentury.

> Then monopolies can keep innovating because profits enable them to make the long-term plans and to finance the ambitious research projectst that firms locked in competition can't dream of.

> Higher education is the place where people who had big plans in high school get stuck in fierce rivalries with requally smart peers over conventional careers like management consulting and investment banking.

> If you are less sensitive to social cues,  you're likely to do the same thing as everyone else around yoo. If you are interested in making things or programming computers, you'll be less afraid to pursue those activities single-mindedly and thereby become incredibly good at them.

> This can save you from getting caught up in crowds competing for obvious prizes. Competition can make people halucinate opportunities where none exist.

> True heroes take their personal honor so seriously they will fight for thigs that don't matter. This twisted logic is a part of human nature but it's disastrous in buissness.

> The initial markets are so small that they often don't even appear to be buissness opportunities at all.

> A good startup should have the potential for great scale built into its first design.

> The perfect target market for a startup is a small group of particular people concentraded together by few or no competitors.

> As you craft a plan to expand to adjacent markets, don't disrupt: avoid competition as much as possible.

> Jose Raul Capablanca said: To succeed you must study the endgame before everything else.

> We are more fascinated today by statistical predictions of what the country will be thinking in a few weeks' time than by visionary predictions of what country will look like 10 or 20 years from now.

> A startup is the largest endeavour over which you can have a definite mastery. You can have agency not just over your own life, but over a small and important part of the world. It begins by rejecting the unjust Tyrrany of Chance. You are not a lottery ticket.

> You should focuse relentlessly on something you're good at doing, but before you must think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.

> The best enterpreneurs knows this: every great buissness is built around a secret that's hidden from the outside. A great company is a conspiracy to change the world; when you share your secret, the recipient becomes a fellow conspirador.

> A start-up messed up at it's foundation cannot be fixed.

> Founders should share a prehistory before they start a company together - otherwise they're just rolling a dice.

> A product is viral of its core functionality  encourages users  to invite their friends to become users too.

> The most valuable buisnesses of coming decades will be built by enterprenuers who seek to empower people rather than try to make them obsolete.

> Doing something different is what's truly good for society - and it's also what allows a business to profit by monopolizing a new market.

> Our task today is to find singular ways to create the new things that will make the future not just different, but better - to go from 0 to 1.
